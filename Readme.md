[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bnw/firefly-iii-fints-importer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bnw/firefly-iii-fints-importer)

This tool allows you to import transactions from your [FinTS enabled bank](https://subsembly.com/banken.html) into [Firefly III](https://www.firefly-iii.org/).  
It comes with a web GUI that guides you through the process.

Startup
-------

Start the app by executing the following commands.
```
git clone https://github.com/bnw/firefly-iii-fints-importer.git
cd firefly-iii-fints-importer
composer install
php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 app/index.php
```

Alternatively, you can use docker-compose:
```
git clone https://github.com/bnw/firefly-iii-fints-importer.git
cd firefly-iii-fints-importer
docker-compose up
```

Browse to http://localhost:8080 and follow the instructions ðŸ™‚

Storing configurations
----------------------

Instead of entering all necessary account information every time, you can load it from a JSON-file.  
Simply create such a JSON-file in the `data/configurations` folder by adapting the provieded [`data/configurations/example.json`](data/configurations/example.json). When starting the app in your browser, you can then choose the JSON-file as a configuration source.  
Please note that the `bank_2fa`-value in the JSON file corresponds to the number of the 2-factor authentication as listed in [`app/public/html/collecting-data.twig`](app/public/html/collecting-data.twig).  
Thanks to [joBr99](https://github.com/joBr99) for this feature!


Requirements
------------
* Docker **or** (PHP 7.3 or newer and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/))

  * It must be reachable over the network by PHP from the computer you run this import app
  * A Personal Access Token which you can generate on the Profile page in Firefly III 
  
  
Feedback
--------
So far, I could only test this with my personal bank.
If you find that it does not work with your bank, please [open an issue](https://github.com/bnw/firefly-iii-fints-importer/issues/new).
